I would like to thank Michael Wibmer, for his patience, ideas and support throughout the thesis. This thesis would certainly not have been possible if it was not for his mentoring.
In the time spent working on this thesis, I did not only learn about difference algebra, but also about how to do mathematics in general - and how to work in a more clean way, and I have Michael Wibmer to thank for this.
I would also like to thank Julia Harmann for her patience as well, and help in writing this thesis.
Finally, I would like to thank Daniel Rettstadt, Annette Maier and Stefan Ernst for the numerous times I had smaller and not-so-small questions and they were always ready and willing to help me with them.
