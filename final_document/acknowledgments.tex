I would like to thank Michael Wibmer, for his patience, ideas and support throughout the work on this thesis. Writing this thesis would certainly not have been possible if it was not for his mentoring.
In the time spent working on this thesis, I did not only learn about difference algebra, but also how to do mathematics in general, and I have Michael Wibmer to thank for this.
I would also like to thank Julia Harmann for her patience and help in writing this thesis.
Finally, I would like to thank Daniel Rettstadt, Annette Maier and Stefan Ernst for always offering advice the numerous times I had smaller and not-so-small problems and/or questions.
