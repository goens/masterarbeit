I would like to thank Michael Wibmer, for his patience, ideas and support throughout the thesis. This thesis would certainly not have been possible if it was not for his mentoring.
I would also like to thank Julia Harmann for her patience as well, and help in writing this thesis.
Finally, I would like to thank Daniel Rettstadt, Annette Maier and Stefan Ernst for the numerous times I had smaller and not-so-small questions and they were always ready and willing to help me with them.
