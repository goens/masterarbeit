Blah blah difference algebra. 

In this thesis we will develop the basis for studying geometric aspects of difference algebraic structures based on mixed difference ideals, in contrast to the usual theory which is based on perfect difference ideals, a subclass of the former. Section 1 shall serve as an introduction to difference algebra, presenting most basic definitions and some of the more known results concerning perfect ideals and their geometric aspects.
The main goal of the thesis will be to study the results presented there and ...( redundant?? )
Section 2 begins with a more in-depth study of difference ideals, with a particular emphasis on mixed difference ideals.
Section 3 continues with a more geometric nature, presenting a definition of mixed difference varieties as well as some basic properties of these. 
Finally, Section 4 deals with a concrete method for studying difference ideals, namely through so-called difference kernels. In this section a result is presented which higlights the difference to perfect difference ideals.
Also, a result of more geometric nature is presented where a higher degree of generalization is achieved (FIXME: reformulate!)
